2. Speech recognition only
3. Mobile-first

-------------

1. Offline support

Known Issues
------------

1. Does not work well on large screens. If you are using Google Chrome, try opening the Developer Tools and turn on the device toolbar. This will allow you to view the site through a smaller screen. (More like mobile-*only*, am I right?)
2. Does not play nice with Safari.
