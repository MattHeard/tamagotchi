# To Do

## User testing

Because the UI comprises only emoji, there will be a variety of utterances used in an attempt to interact with the cat. How should these be handled?

* *are you hungry* -> H
* *do you want something to eat* -> F
* *what do you need* -> Thought bubble
* *want something to eat* -> F
* *hungry* -> H
* *do you need any food* -> F
* *do you want some bread* -> feed bread
* *have some bread* -> feed bread
* *eat some bread* -> feed bread
* *want some lollies* -> feed candy
* *want a lolly* -> feed candy
* *want some candy* -> feed candy
* *want a snack* -> feed candy
* *are you really hungry*
* *how hungry are you*
* *are you very hungry*
